# Math144Project

## Introduction
For this personal dataset project I decided to explore access to green space and health outcomes in New York State. The initial data came from the CDC National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network and the New York Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) scraping some data from their ISBN codes through the Android Book Catalogue app. The initial DeFordBooks.csv was exported from the app directly.  

## Data Processing

In order to carry out the analysis below, I removed some columns that were mostly empty or didn't have interesting information and condensed some of the columns that had too many classes. I also added a couple of binary columns (kids and math) to make some of the analysis easier. The transformed data is uploaded here, along with the processing script.
